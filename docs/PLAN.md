# Plan for AltEgo

This project will be written in Python + TKinter.
The interface will mimic the Maltego interface in terms of feel but not looks as its Tkinter.

The application will be split up with the "backend" logic being a library module and the "cli" and "gui" components being seperate folders both communicating with the "backend".
